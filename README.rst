FAQ
===

Is this a clone of WebAnywhere?
-------------------------------

No. JSonic is a speech and sound API that web developers can use to create self-voicing web applications.

Is this an add-on like Firevox, Accessibar, FoxyVoice, etc.?
------------------------------------------------------------

No. See above.

Where's the JSonic server located?
----------------------------------

I don't run a server for public use. You can run your own server by following the instructions in the documentation linked above.
